# This is a NodeJs Restful API Built with Express and Mongodb for TrustMeSecurity Web and Mobile Application

you can use it to connect with any front end framework or libraries if you follow the instructions correctly.

#CAUTION

# please Note that every response or request happening in this Application returns data in

# {JSON format} which mean if you are using any technology you are using be able to handle json data

#1: On This App before adding any data routes to add data to the system routes are secured using JsonWebToken so to be able to add data you need to register account as Adminstrator and that's the only account needed because adding data will be handle by Adminstrator only. After you add registration as Adminstrator for the API to be able to add any data to the forms the Adminstrator must use a token to be able to add any data in system.

# As a developer you need to handle the login session by storing the token somewhere safe so that the user can be able to login automatically without any hustle. the token expires after 2hrs. to be able to add a token then token is using (auth-token) as a header value the you add your token you collected from login. All register, login, add , and get routes are working mistakes no routes is fixed every time discovered.

##To test if the api working well use PostMan or any application that helps to test RestfulAPIs.

# please find testing json files on the folder api-json-test-files. For login auth headers there is a screen shot

with an example on how you add Auth token.

#2: Scheduling: {Coming Soon!}
